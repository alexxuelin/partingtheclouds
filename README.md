CS 171 Final Project

# Parting the Clouds

The main goal of this project is to provide users with relevant data on suicide, as it pertains to certain demogrpahics
and resources. We are first displaying perecentages of suicidal thoughts and actions across different groups, and then
showing users that they are not alone with certain feelings they may be having. The website also offers encouragement
with the "It Gets Better" page, and then provides resources across the country that one can contact.

This project utilizes a number of libraries, which include bootstrap.min.js, d3.min.js, d3-tip.js, jquery.fullPage.js,
jquery.min.js, nouislider.min,js, queue.min.js, topojson.js, and wNumb.js. vis1.js, vis2.js, vis2visualization.js,
vis3.js, and vis4.js are our own code, and are supplemented by the github examples listed in the reference page.
